# Flight-Delay-Prediction-using-Big-Data-Machine-Learning
Predicting airline flight delays using advanced machine learning models and Big Data analytics — featuring SVM, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost.
Flight delays are a major challenge in the aviation industry, leading to operational inefficiencies, financial losses, and passenger dissatisfaction. With the exponential growth of flight data and weather information, traditional analytical methods are no longer sufficient to handle such large-scale, diverse, and fast-changing datasets.This project applies Big Data analytics and Machine Learning techniques to predict flight delays based on multiple operational and environmental factors such as carrier delays, weather conditions, NAS (National Airspace System) delays, and late aircraft arrivals.Using advanced algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost, the model learns from historical flight data to classify whether a flight is likely to be delayed or on time.The ultimate goal is to build a scalable, data-driven system that can help airlines and airports proactively manage operations, reduce delays, and enhance passenger experience through predictive intelligence.
